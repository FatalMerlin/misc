Miscellaneous Snippets and Mini-Projects.

The code snippets in this repository are a collection of small scripts I wrote ad-hoc as needed. I am collecting them here to avoid losing them to time, and in hopes that sharing them might benefit anyone that comes across them. If you have questions about any of the contained scripts or want to extend them, feel free to open and issue or PR, or message me about it.

Note: These snippets are often written for a singular purpose and only rarely adhere to coding best practices, essentially often a "quick-and-dirty" approach.
